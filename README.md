# Threvolution - [Hemispheric University Consortium Social Ideas Challenge](https://www.thehuc.org/social-ideas-challenge/) :dress:
In my Fall 2021 semester, I entered a competition in which students are encouraged to solve socio-economic problems with ideas that fall within the [United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals). My group decided to create Threvolution, which follows Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities & Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. As a company, Threvolution would offer fully thrifted custom style packages to its users. Using a website, customers would be able to submit four to eight photos of their favorite trends, and Threvolution would handpick four to five thrifted articles of clothing that best match their fashion taste. Through this idea, customers would be encouraged to choose sustainable practices (such as thrifting) to combat fast fashion, which has resulted in an excessive amount of non-biodegradable clothing being sent to landfills and has contributed significantly to water pollution. In addition, Threvolution's success would pressure companies to give garment workers higher wages and to improve their work environment.
